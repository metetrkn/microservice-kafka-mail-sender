Objective: Assess performance impact of count of consumers and threads at the same time. Method: 3 repetitions across 2 scenarios (6 total tests).

Test Structure & Observation
Baseline (IDs 0–2): Three repetitions of the initial configuration.
New Parameters (IDs 3–5): Three repetitions of the modified configuration.

Note: Performance consistently improves across repetitions (e.g., Run 2 > Run 0), likely due to system warm-up or caching.
Objective: Compare the Baseline group against the New Parameters group, taking this warm-up trend into account to ensure a fair analysis.

1. High Priority Mails (high-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Improved by 15.11% (Dropped from 2.69s to 2.28s).
Max Execution Time: Improved by 11.88% (Dropped from 4.03s to 3.55s).

2. Low Priority Mails (low-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Improved by 4.58% (Dropped from 2.97s to 2.83s).
Max Execution Time: Improved by 3.03% (Dropped from 4.49s to 4.35s).

Result:
Doubling threads and consumers simultaneously per topic (from 4 to 8) yielded a modest performance increase, but the improvement was not drastic.
Each consumer (in their own topic group) shared similar workload as it should be
