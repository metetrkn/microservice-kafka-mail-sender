Test Structure & Observation
Baseline (IDs 0–2): Three repetitions of the initial configuration.
New Parameters (IDs 3–5): Three repetitions of the modified configuration.

Note: Performance consistently improves across repetitions (e.g., Run 2 > Run 0), likely due to system warm-up or caching.
Objective: Compare the Baseline group against the New Parameters group, taking this warm-up trend into account to ensure a fair analysis.

1. High Priority Mails (high-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Slightly improved by 1.83% (Dropped from 2.30s to 2.25s).
Max Execution Time: Improved by 7.00% (Dropped from 3.73s to 3.47s).

2. Low Priority Mails (low-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Slightly degraded by 1.12% (Rose from 2.68s to 2.71s).
Max Execution Time: Improved by 6.49% (Dropped from 4.26s to 3.98s).

Result:
Increasing partitions, threads, and consumers simultaneously resulted in negligible performance changes. 
Since previous tests showed that adding threads/consumers improves performance while adding partitions degrades it, 
these opposing effects likely cancelled each other out. Workload remained evenly distributed across consumers.
