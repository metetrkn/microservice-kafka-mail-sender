Test Structure & Observation
Baseline (IDs 0–2): Three repetitions of the initial configuration.
New Parameters (IDs 3–5): Three repetitions of the modified configuration.

Note: Performance consistently improves across repetitions (e.g., Run 2 > Run 0), likely due to system warm-up or caching.
Objective: Compare the Baseline group against the New Parameters group, taking this warm-up trend into account to ensure a fair analysis.

1. High Priority Mails (high-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Improved by 18.28% (Dropped from 2.35s to 1.92s)
Max Execution Time: Improved by 16.76% (Dropped from 3.68s to 3.06s)

2. Low Priority Mails (low-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Improved by 18.77% (Dropped from 2.78s to 2.26s)
Max Execution Time: Improved by 17.73% (Dropped from 4.36s to 3.59s)

Result: 
Doubling threads per topic (from 4 to 8) yielded a modest performance increase, but the improvement was not drastic.
Each consumer (in their own topic group) shared similar workload as it should be.
