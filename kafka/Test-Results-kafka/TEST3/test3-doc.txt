Test Structure & Observation
Baseline (IDs 0–2): Three repetitions of the initial configuration.
New Parameters (IDs 3–5): Three repetitions of the modified configuration.

Note: Performance consistently improves across repetitions (e.g., Run 2 > Run 0), likely due to system warm-up or caching.
Objective: Compare the Baseline group against the New Parameters group, taking this warm-up trend into account to ensure a fair analysis.

1. High Priority Mails (high-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Increased by 38.70% (Rose from 1.71s to 2.37s).
Max Execution Time: Increased by 35.93% (Rose from 2.74s to 3.73s).

2. Low Priority Mails (low-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Increased by 15.40% (Rose from 2.27s to 2.62s).
Max Execution Time: Increased by 15.29% (Rose from 3.56s to 4.11s).

Result: 
Increasing partitions in isolation caused a drastic performance decrease.
Cause: High overhead from partition rebalancing (dynamic assignment of consumers).
Workload distribution remained balanced across consumers as it should be.
