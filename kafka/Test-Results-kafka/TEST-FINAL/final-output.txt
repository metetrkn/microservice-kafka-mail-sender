Refined Insights
1> Maintain a 1:1:1 Ratio Ensure 1 partition = 1 consumer = 1 thread for maximum resource utilization.
2> Maximize Batch Sizes within Global Limits Target large batches, but strictly cap total processing capacity: (Total High Consumers × High Batch) + (Total Low Consumers × Low Batch) < 800
3> Tune Polling Frequency by Priority Reduce polling on low-priority topics to save resources, but keep high-priority polling frequent. (Avoid over-polling empty queues).
4> Manage Concurrency & API Limits Batch size directly correlates to the number of open HTTP sockets. If simultaneous requests exceed Mailgun's concurrency limit, you will trigger "Too Many Requests" errors.
5> Production Tuning Levers
	- If System Overloaded (CPU/RAM): Scale down high-priority concurrency (e.g., reduce partitions/consumers from 6 → 4).
	- If API Rate Limited (Mailgun): Decrease the batch size for low-priority topics first

Sequential Load Test (11 × 11k) Trigger the producer 11 times manually. Each click generates 11,000 emails (1k High / 10k Low) for a total of 121,000.
{HIGH}: max: 1.89, avg:0.62, {LOW}: max: 9.17, avg:2.47

Burst Load Test (121k) Trigger the producer once to immediately inject all 121,000 emails into the system at the same time.
{HIGH}: max: 10.04, avg:6.43, {LOW}: max: 39.71, avg:23.80
