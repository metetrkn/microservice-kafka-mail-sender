Test Structure & Observation
Baseline (IDs 0–1): 2 repetitions of the initial configuration.
New Parameters (IDs 2–4): 2 repetitions of the modified configuration.
New Parameters (IDs 5–6): 2 more repetitions of the newer modified configuration.

Note: Performance consistently improves across repetitions (e.g., Run 1 > Run 0), likely due to system warm-up or caching.
Objective: Compare the Baseline group against the New Parameters group, taking this warm-up trend into account to ensure a fair analysis.

1. High Priority Mails (high-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Improved by 61.94% (Dropped from 4.71 s to 1.79 s)
Max Execution Time: Improved by 50.18%  (Dropped from 6.44 s to 3.21 s).

2. Low Priority Mails (low-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Improved by 6.53% (Dropped from 2.61 s to 2.44 s).
Max Execution Time: Improved by 6.85% (Dropped from 4.23 s to 3.94 s).

2,3 vs 4,5 (5 batch vs 10 batch)
1. High Priority Mails (high-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Dropped by 11.71% (Increased from 1.79 s s to 2.00 s)
Max Execution Time: Dropped by 1.52%  (Increased from 3.21 s to 3.26 s).

2. Low Priority Mails (low-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Dropped by 40.61% (Dropped from 2.44 s to 3.42 s).
Max Execution Time: Dropped by +37.88% (Dropped from 3.94 s to 5.44 s).


Result: Not using batching (batch size = 1) gave the worst performance. 
However, using a very large batch size (batch size = 10) also degraded performance. The best performance was with a batch size of 5. 
The solution is to enable batching, but avoid setting the batch size too high. 
Each consumer (in its own consumer group) handled a similar amount of work, as expected.
