Test Structure & Observation
Baseline (IDs 0–2): Three repetitions of the initial configuration.
New Parameters (IDs 3–5): Three repetitions of the modified configuration.

Note: Performance consistently improves across repetitions (e.g., Run 2 > Run 0), likely due to system warm-up or caching.
Objective: Compare the Baseline group against the New Parameters group, taking this warm-up trend into account to ensure a fair analysis.

1. High Priority Mails (high-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Drastically improved by 46.04% (Dropped from 2.22s to 1.20s).
Max Execution Time: Drastically improved by 46.43% (Dropped from 3.54s to 1.89s).

2. Low Priority Mails (low-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Improved by 14.89% (Dropped from 2.59s to 2.20s).
Max Execution Time: Improved by 9.10% (Dropped from 4.11s to 3.74s).

Result: 
We tested the isolated impact of thread counts. Doubling the threads from 4 to 8 per topic resulted in significant performance gains.
But 2 high consumers were idling.
