Increase the number of sent emails by 10× to observe the effect per queue using the best test case settings (Test 3) (stress test).

Observations:
	- The system was under heavy load but still handled all emails without errors and without extreme spikes in CPU usage.
	- Even under high traffic, high-priority emails were processed quickly.

Overall, this test case delivered good results under both low traffic (1,100 emails) and high traffic (11,000 emails).
