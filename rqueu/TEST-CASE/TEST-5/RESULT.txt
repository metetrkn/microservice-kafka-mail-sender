Result:
	- Our primary goal was to create a high-throughput system for high-priority emails.
	- Test 3 produced the best results for high-priority emails while not consuming the most system resources.
	- The CSV file graph evaluation also shows a drastic decrease in execution time from Test 2 to Test 3, with almost no change between Test 3 and Test 4.

BEST USE CASE is TEST-3!
