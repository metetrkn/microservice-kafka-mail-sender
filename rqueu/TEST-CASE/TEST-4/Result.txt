Drastically increase low-priority email concurrency and observe its effect on the system.

scenerio														<BEFORE TEST PARAMETERS>    
queu	num_mails	Error	concurrency	avg_time	max_time	cpu     memory  performance_monitor
high	100			0		10-20		0.94		1.19		10%		40%	 	10-20
low		1000		0		10-20		4.08		7.96		10%		40%	 	10-20

Observations:
	- The system was under much higher load compared to the lower-concurrency test cases.
	- Low-priority email performance increased drastically (2×), while high-priority email performance worsened (2×).
