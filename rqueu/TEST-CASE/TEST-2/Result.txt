queu		num_mails		Error		concurrency	avg_time	max_time	cpu     memory   performance_monitor
high		100				0			5-10		1.09		1.77		10%		40%	 	10-20
low			1000			0			5-10		9.11		18.37		10%		40%	 	10-20

Observations:
	- System was not overloaded.
	- Increasing concurrency for low-priority emails from 1–2 to 5–10 drastically improved performance, while high-priority emails were not negatively affected.
